# [ICCV2025] IRGPT: A Large-scale Real-world Infrared Image Dataset

Welcome to the official repository of the IRGPT dataset, introduced in our ICCV 2025 paper:  
**"IRGPT: Understanding Real-world Infrared Image with Bi-cross-modal Curriculum on Large-scale Benchmark"**

## Overview

IRGPT is a comprehensive large-scale benchmark designed for real-world infrared image understanding. The dataset contains over **XX,XXX** images collected from diverse environments, annotated with rich labels including (object detection / segmentation / classification / etc.).  
Key features:
- Diverse scenes covering urban, suburban, industrial, and night-time conditions
- Fine-grained annotations (bounding boxes, masks, categories, etc.)
- High-resolution thermal infrared imagery
